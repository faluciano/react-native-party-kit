### Added: `useExtractAssets()` hook for Android asset extraction

New hook that extracts bundled web assets from the APK to the filesystem on Android. Uses the manifest generated by `couch-kit bundle` to copy each file via `expo-file-system`.

- Takes an `AssetManifest` parameter (generated by `couch-kit bundle --manifest`)
- Returns `{ staticDir, loading, error }`
- On iOS, skips extraction (server uses bundle path fallback)
- Replaces the need for `react-native-fs` in consumer apps
